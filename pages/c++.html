            <h1>What is C++ ?</h1>
            <hr>
            <p>C++ is a powerful and versatile programming language that is widely used for developing a variety of software applications. It was created as an extension of the C programming language, adding features such as object-oriented programming (OOP) and support for generic programming. C++ is known for its efficiency, flexibility, and performance, making it suitable for developing anything from system software and games to applications for embedded systems and high-performance computing. It offers a rich set of features including classes, inheritance, polymorphism, templates, and standard libraries, making it a popular choice among developers for building complex and scalable software solutions.</p>

            <h2>Advantages and disadvantages of C++</h2>
            <p>C++ comes with a mix of advantages and disadvantages. Some of its advantages such as high-performance and control come with the challenge of complexity and steep learning curves.</p>

            <h3>Advantages of C++</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><span>High performance</span> from C++'s low-level memory manipulation and direct access to hardware, making it suitable for resource-intensive applications.</li>
                <li><span>Control</span>, such as low-level control over system resources, which enables developers to fine-tune their programs for optimal performance.</li>
                <li><span>Flexibility</span> resulting from functionality such as the support of OOP and procedural and functional programming, the latter of which is increasingly embraced at enterprise scale.</li>
                <li><span>Software portability</span> that lets programs run on several different platforms.</li>
                <li><span>Compatibility</span> coming from C++'s interoperability with other programming languages such as C and its support across different platforms. This lets developers reuse code and use third-party libraries.</li>
                <li><span>An expansive ecosystem</span> tied to C++'s ability to use a large array of libraries and frameworks that offer prebuilt approaches for tasks, such as data manipulation, which reduces the need for manual implementation.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Disadvantages of C++</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><span>Complexity</span> and a challenging learning curve for beginners because of its extensive feature set.</li>
                <li><span>Manual memory management,</span> which can lead to memory leaks and other memory management issues if not handled properly.</li>
                <li><span>Security risks</span> related to C++'s direct access to memory, which increases risk of writing unsafe code.</li>
                <li><span>Lack of built-in garbage collection</span> forcing developers to manually deallocate memory when it's no longer needed.</li>
                <li><span>Complex syntax</span> compared to other programming languages, making code reading and writing more time-consuming.</li>
                <li><span>Long compile time</span> compared to languages with dynamic typing or just-in-time compilation.</li>
            </ul>
