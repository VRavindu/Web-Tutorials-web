            <h1>What is Python?</h1>
            <hr>
            <p>Python is a very popular general-purpose interpreted, interactive, object-oriented, 
                and high-level programming language. Python is dynamically-typed and garbage-collected 
                programming language. It was created by Guido van Rossum during 1985- 1990. Like Perl, 
                Python source code is also available under the GNU General Public License (GPL).</p>
        
            <h3>Why to Learn Python?</h3>

            <p>Python is consistently rated as one of the world's most popular programming languages. 
                Python is fairly easy to learn, so if you are starting to learn any programming 
                language then Python could be your great choice. Today various Schools, Colleges 
                and Universities are teaching Python as their primary programming language. 
                There are many other good reasons which makes Python as the top choice of any programmer:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Python is Open Source which means its available free of cost.</li>
                <li>Python is simple and so easy to learn</li>
                <li>Python is versatile and can be used to create many different things.</li>
                <li>Python has powerful development libraries include AI, ML etc.</li>
                <li>Python is much in demand and ensures high salary</li>
            </ul>
        
            <h2>Careers with Python</h2>
            <p>If you know Python nicely, then you have a great career ahead. Here are just a few of the career options where Python is a key skill:</p>

            <h2>Applications of Python</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Easy-to-learn − </b>Python has few keywords, simple structure, and a clearly defined syntax. This allows the student to pick up the language quickly.</li>
                <li><b>Easy-to-read − </b>Python code is more clearly defined and visible to the eyes.</li>
                <li><b>Easy-to-maintain − </b>Python's source code is fairly easy-to-maintain.</li>
                <li><b>A broad standard library − </b>Python's bulk of the library is very portable and cross-platform compatible on UNIX, Windows, and Macintosh.</li>
                <li><b>Interactive Mode − </b>Python has support for an interactive mode which allows interactive testing and debugging of snippets of code.</li>
                <li><b>Extendable − </b>You can add low-level modules to the Python interpreter. These modules enable programmers to add to or customize their tools to be more efficient.</li>
                <li><b>Databases − </b>Python provides interfaces to all major commercial databases.</li>
            </ul>
